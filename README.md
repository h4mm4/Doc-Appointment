**Explanation of how ethical web development principles (such as principles found here:

  We’re building a website that makes finding and booking a GP as straightforward as checking your email. It’s designed to be super user-friendly so that anyone, regardless of their tech skills, can use it hassle-free. We want to make sure that everyone, from tech novices to pros, can access our services easily. To do this, we’re focusing on making the site clear and simple to navigate, and ensuring it works well on all devices, from phones to desktops.

Privacy is a big deal for us, especially because we handle health information. We take every precaution to keep your data safe, using the latest security measures. Our site will ask only for the information we absolutely need to make your appointment happen, and nothing else. We promise to always be clear about what we’re doing with your data and to ask for your permission first. This isn’t just about following laws like the General Data Protection Regulation; it's about making sure you feel safe and trust us with your personal details.

We believe in being open about how we do things. We use open-source technology, which means anyone can check out how our site is built. We love getting feedback—it helps us improve and make sure our site really works for you. By being transparent and inviting community input, we keep ourselves accountable and ensure our website is a reliable and ethical place for you to manage your healthcare needs.
