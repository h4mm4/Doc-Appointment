We're building a website that will make booking a GP as easy as sending an email. It's created with everyone in mind, whether you're a digital expert or someone who struggles with technology. Our platform is simple to use, intuitive, and works flawlessly whether you're on your phone during your commute or on your computer at home. Our mission is straightforward: to make healthcare accessible to everyone, everywhere, with only a few clicks.

Here is our commitment to managing your data responsibly:

Privacy: Your personal information is protected by the greatest security measures available, and it is only accessible to those who really need it.

Confidentiality: We treat your details as if they were our own, never sharing them without your explicit permission.

Transparency: We inform you what data we require and why. We believe in keeping you in the loop.

Accountability: We take data issues seriously and address them front on. You entrust us with your information, and we uphold that confidence with rigorous standards.

Data minimization: We keep to the essentials. Only the information required for your visit is gathered.

Informed Consent: Every piece of data we gather has a clear explanation and requires your permission.

Purpose Limitation: We only use your information to schedule your GP appointments.

Fairness: We provide equal service to everyone, regardless of who they are or where they come from.

Accuracy: We verify that your information is correct and up to date, allowing us to accurately meet your healthcare needs.

We've also increased our website security:
Data Security: We've put in place extensive safeguards against unauthorized access and data breaches.

User Control: You have complete control over your data; you can access, alter, or delete it at any moment.

Compliance: To maintain high standards and transparency in our processes, we strictly adhere to legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation.

With these ideals at the forefront, our platform does more than just help you book appointments; it also ensures that you can manage your healthcare with confidence and security. Our goal is to make our website a dependable, safe, and accessible tool for everyone, simplifying how you connect with healthcare services.
